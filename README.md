# Py_Invaders
This is a pygame project that copies space invaders
This is my first time really using python or pygame so I am shure that this script is not effecient


In order to play this game you need:

1. Have python installed
2. Have pygame installed

If you are unsure how to install pygame run: pip install pygame
(this will only work if python is also installed)

If you have never seen github and unsure how to download you can press the download zip button, although its recommended to use git clone command
Then assuming python and pygame are installed type python main.py into the command line or right click run with... and choose python in file explorer.
make shure you are in the right directory in the command line
